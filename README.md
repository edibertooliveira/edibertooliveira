# My value

I am a highly detail-oriented person with a great sense of collaboration and teamwork. I am in constant learning, participating in programming events to have contact with other developers.

# ABOUT ME

In my free time I like to walk, go to the beach mainly to feel the energy of nature. I have a passion for series and films, I love the Star Wars franchise. But I spend most of my time perfecting my knowledge on my computer screen.

# Would you like to find me?
